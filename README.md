# Regression 
- Linear regression
  - Linear regression is a statistical machine learning method you can use to quantify and make predictions based on relationships between numerical variables
    1. Simple Linear Regression :- One predictor and One Predictant

    2. Multiple Lenear Regression :-  Multiple Predictor and One Predictant.
    
    Assumptions
    1. All variables are continuous numeric, not categorical.
    2. Data is free of missing values and outliers.
    3. There is a linear relationship between predictor and predictant.
    4. All predictors ane ndependent each other.
    5. Residuals are normally distributed.
